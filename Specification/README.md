Field Guide Specification
=========================

If this dream becomes reality, this project will grow in size and become huge.

Specifications must be created so that multiple people can collaborate and work
together on this project.

I do propose a hierarchical structure with paid positions. Volunteer content
would be awesome but it needs to be paid, if someone has the means they and
wants to donate it back, that would be fine.

I want these positions paid before the First edition.


Chief Editor
------------

The chief editor is responsible for the project as a whole, for reviewing pull
requests from taxon curators and rejecting or accepting them as needed, for
making sure the ePub that is distributed is of the highest quality possible.

What to pay has not been thought out. This is what I want to do, the Zeroth
editions will be my resume.


Taxon Curator
-------------

An editor responsible for a particular taxonomy group. For example, it is
likely that all Reptiles and Amphibians would be considered tohether as a
taxon group with a single curator responsible for the content related to
that group.

On the other hand, Insects is probably such a large grouping that it would
require multiple groupings with multiple taxon curators in order to keep
the quality high.

A Taxon Curator should be passionate and well-informed about the taxon
group they are responsible for, but also must be technical savvy.

To that end, team curation with two (or more) people working together may
be used.

What to pay has not been thought out. Initially I am doing it all, after the
Zeroth point First edition, other curators will be sought.

What to pay has not been thought out. I would like to be the Taxon Curator for
Reptiles and Amphibians.


Content Author
--------------

A naturalist who wished to write species descriptions, identification keys,
and other written content within the ePub spine. A Taxon Curator likely will
double as a Content Author but that does not need to be the case.

A Content Author will clone the `git` repository relevant to the taxon group
they are creating content for. After creating their content, the Content Author
will submit a pull request to the Taxon Curator. The Taxon Curator, when they
are satisfied with the added content within their taxon group, will then do a
pull request with the main development branch.

I propose paying $100 for each article a Content Author creates that makes it
into the next edition. Articles would be a species account, identification key,
guide to making observations, etc.


Expert Review
-------------

For species accounts and other accounts where scientific information is
presented, I believe it is important for the article to be reviewed by an actual
scientist for both technical accuracy and and to make sure important key facts
are not excluded.

The expert should either have a Masters degree in the field or have a four year
degree and is either working on a Masters or currently be working in the field.

My *personal* preference would be to use reviewers active in Science
Communication in social media (e.g. [#SciComm on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SciComm))
as they have a passion for all things science and for helping the general public
understand their passion.

It will largely be up the Taxon Curator to find reviewers but I do not think the
decision should solely be theirs as payment for a review must be made before the
review takes place.


Photographer
------------

When a photograph (or other non-text resource) is used, I want the content
creator to be paid. Such content __MUST__ be released under a license that
specifically allows it to be used without pay, but I still want it paid for.

I propose $15.00 per resource for the first five resources, followed by $5.00
for each additional resource by the same creator, that are new to the project
(e.g. a resource in first edition does not need to be paid for again when used
in the second edition).

Part of the job of a curator will be to make lists of resources that are needed
so that naturalists who want to contribute and have the equipment to do so can
now what type of resources are needed the most.

It will need to be made very clear content providers that a curator adding their
resource does not mean it will be used in the next edition, and that if it is
used in the next edition, it is not a guarantee that they will be paid.

During preparation for the publishing of an edition, the funds needed to pay for
each resource can be calculated and if the funds do not exist, a fundraiser to
reach that amount can be tried, but I do not want lack of funds to prevent the
publication.

It is my *hope* that enough funding to pay for resources can be raised after
the publication of a new edition but that may take some time to establish.


Vector Illustrator
------------------

Photographs are useful but for many things, vector illustrations are more
useful. For example, illustrating the labials on gartersnakes or comparing the
back of the carapace of a Western Pond Turtle vs. Red-Eared Slider.


Urban Trail Guides
------------------

This project is about more than just the ePub.

There are a lot of trails in Contra Costa Costa that go into relatively remote
habitat, but there also are a lot of trails within urban areas that are easily
accessible for those with disabilities, by bus, etc.

I think a worthwhile part of this project is non-digital. Naturalists who enjoy
a particular urban trail giving occassional tours of the trail to those in the
community who are interested.

It would be nice to compensate the naturalist for giving those hikes.

Part of being an Urban Trail Guide would involve maintaining a page in the ePub
detailing what can be spotted on the trail, including seasonal information.


Branch Issues
-------------

Merging different branches in `git` can sometimes be tricky if multiple people
are working on the same file.

For this reason, it is my position that only a Taxon Curator should be able to
add files to their branch. They can add a stuff for the file to be created by
a Content Author and the Content Author then only edits the files they have
been given permission to work on.

When things like grammar are being worked on by someone other than the Content
Author responsible for the content, the Content Author should probably refrain
from editing their branch until the Taxon Curator has accepted the pull request
of the other editors so that the Content Author can sync their branch etc.

Some of these git management protocols will have to be figured out as time
goes on. Hopefully merge issues are rare.

But I got this.
