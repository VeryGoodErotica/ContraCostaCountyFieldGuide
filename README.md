Contra Costa County - A Field Guide for the Living
==================================================

This is a very ambitious project to produce a high quality ePub field guide for
all living organisms within Contra Costa County.

The project will likely never be completed, however, it will be quite usable
without being complete.

The Zeroth edition will include twelve species that can be found in the
general vicinity of Marsh Creek Trail between Sunset Rd. and Delta Rd. in
Brentwood, California. The species accounts will very much be incomplete but
at least it will give a concept of the project.

The Zeroth point First edition will *hopefully* cover most vertebrates and many
plant species that can be commonly encountered along that same trail.

The first edition will hopefully cover every Reptile and Amphibian species
and most *native* mammal species, along with a large number of commonly
encountered birds.

Seven of the first dozen species have already been chosen:

* Eurasian Collared Dove
* Great Blue Heron
* White Crowned Sparrow
* Yellow-rumped Warbler
* Western Pond Turtle
* California Ground Squirrel
* California Harvester Ant

Candidates for the additional five include:

* Western Fence Lizard
* Sierran Chorus Frog
* Pacific Gophersnake

Both lists are subject to change.
