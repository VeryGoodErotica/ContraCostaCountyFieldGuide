  <p>This is a ‘working concept’ pre-release version of the guide and is bound to have some severe issues.</p>
  <p>The Zeroth edition will be ‘official’ when a dozen species that can be found in the vicinity of Marsh Creek Trail between Sunset Road and Delta Road have complete species descriptions, even if they could use improvement.</p>
  <p>Subject to Change list:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Eurasian Collared Dove</li>
    <li>Great Blue Heron</li>
    <li>White Crowned Sparrow</li>
    <li>Yellow-rumped Warbler</li>
    <li>Western Pond Turtle</li>
    <li>California Ground Squirrel</li>
    <li>California Harvester Ant</li>
    <li>Western Fence Lizard</li>
    <li>Sierran Chorus Frog</li>
    <li>Pacific Gophersnake</li>
    <li>Red-eared Slider</li>
    <li>Silver Lupine</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Zeroth point First edition will <em>hopefully</em> cover the majority of non-fish vertebrates and many plant species that can be found in that same geographic region. This is the edition I plan to use in conjunction with nature hikes I hope to start leading on that trail segment in September of 2020.</p>
  <p>The First edition will not be published until Pipfrosch Press is an actual legal entity with some advisors and funding and hopefully some content curators other than just me. It also will not be published until every Reptile and Amphibian has a decent species profile description, though some may be lacking in photographs.</p>
  <p>More introduction to be written.</p>
