<!-- Letter A -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.allele">Allele</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A specific variation of a gene that occurs at the same place on the chromosome as other variations of the same gene. New alleles are created by random mutations in the copying of existing alleles, and may rapidly spread by organism reproduction through the species via natural selection if the mutation provides a benefit to the species.</dd>
<!-- Letter C -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.cryptic_species_complex">Cryptic Species Complex</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="#gls.species_complex">species complex</a> for which it is very difficult or even impossible to classify some specimens to the specific species within the complex based purely on the visually expressed <a href="#gls.phenotype">phenotype</a>.</dd>
<!-- Letter G -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.genotype">Genotype</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The genetic makeup of a particular individual organism, the specific <a href="#gls.allele">alleles</a> that specific organism inherited from its ancestors.</dd>
<!-- Letter I -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.introgression">Introgression</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The transfer of <a href="#gls.allele">alleles</a> that evolved in one grouping of organisms into another grouping of organisms through hybridization events between the two groupings.</dd>
<!-- Letter M -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.monophyletic">Monophyletic</dfn></dt>
      <dd>When a grouping of organisms is descended from a most recent common ancestor to the exclusion of all organisms not within the grouping, the grouping is called a monophyletic grouping. Contrast with <a href="#gls.paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a>.</dd>
<!-- Letter P -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.paraphyletic">Paraphyletic</dfn></dt>
      <dd>When a grouping of organisms for which known organisms <em>outside</em> the grouping also descended from the most recent common ancestor of the grouping, the grouping is called a paraphyletic group. In the taxonomy ‘Tree of Life’ (e.g. Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, etc.), paraphyletic groups are avoided as much as possible. Contrast with <a href="#gls.monophyletic">monophyletic</a>.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="gls.phenotype">Phenotype</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The observable expression of a <a href="#gls.genotype">genotype</a>, influenced by natural selection or (in captivity) selective breeding. Please note that it is not always easy to determine if an observable characteristic is the result of the genotype or another factor, such as diet or climate.</dd>
<!-- Letter S -->
    <dt><dfn id="gls.species_complex">Species Complex</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Two or more species that are so closely related they are difficult to distinguish from each other and may still have frequently occurring gene flow (<a href="#gls.introgression">introgression</a>) happening.</dd>
