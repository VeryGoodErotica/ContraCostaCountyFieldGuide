  <h1 id="audioh1" class="glossary">Audio Recording Needs</h1>
  <p>I have a financial need for the purchase of audio recording equipment. It is not cheap, but it will greatly benefit the quality of this project.</p>
  <section id="goals" aria-labelledby="goalsh2">
    <h2 id="goalsh2">Audio Goals</h2>
    <p>A long-term goal of this project is to have <em>quality</em> audio recordings, loudness normalized to the <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf" title="Internet Resource" class="PDF">EBU R128</a> Loudness standard, for as many bird, frog, and insect calls as possible.</p>
    <p>For both quality and legal reasons, it really is my preference if these recordings are original to this project with the recordings made in either Contra Costa or Alameda Counties.</p>
    <p>Both birds and frogs, and quite likely insects, have dialects. In fact these dialects often are a part of how <a href="glossary.xhtml#gls.speciation" class="gls">speciation</a> takes place.</p>
    <p>When the dialects in different areas have diverged enough, they create a barrier to gene flow that results in the divergent populations heading down different evolutionary paths.</p>
    <p>It is my <em>strong desire</em> for as many audio recordings as possible to have photo vouchers accompanying the recording to help validate the species that was recorded, along with geolocation data. This information should be vouchered in the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" title="Internet Resource">iNaturalst</a> with audio recordings also submitted to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology <a href="https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/" >Macaulay Library</a>.</p>
    <p>A lot of taxonomy work in birds is taking place, and there certainly will be <a href="glossary.xhtml#gls.cryptic_species_complex" class="gls">Cryptic Species Complexes</a> discovered where variations in the song are one way to distinguish species within the complex.</p>
    <p>With birds, an identifiable photo voucher of the actual bird being recorded can also verify whether the song is coming from a male or female of the species, there is often sexual dimorphism in the singing and it would be great to have songs from both sexes available in the species profiles.</p>

    <h2 id="audiotypesh2">Types of Audio Recordings</h2>
    <p>There are two basic types of audio recordings I want to have as part of this project:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn>Single Specimen Recordings</dfn></dt>
        <dd>This is the recording of the sound made by a specific specimen to the exclusion of noise around it. These recordings are best done with a directional microphone aimed at the specimen to be recorded.</dd>
      <dt><dfn>Chorus Recording</dfn></dt>
        <dd>This is the recording of the sound made by group, often separated from each other enough that directional microphones do not work for this kind of recording.</dd>
