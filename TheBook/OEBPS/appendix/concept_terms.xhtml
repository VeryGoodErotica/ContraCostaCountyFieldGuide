  <h1 id="concepth1" class="glossary">Conceptual Terms</h1>
  <p>This appendix contains terms of a conceptual nature that are intrinsicly linked categorically.</p>
  <section id="popres" aria-labelledby="popresh2">
    <h2 id="popresh2">Species Population Residence Classification</h2>
    <p>This section defines terms related to the classification of a species based upon the residence nature of the population within Contra Costa County.</p>
    <section id="gls.native_species" aria-labelledby="nativeh3">
      <h3 id="nativeh3">Native Species</h3>
      <p>A naturally occurring species. A <dfn>Native Species</dfn> is a species that reproduces within Contra Costa County for which the reproducing population either dispersed into Contra Costa College by natural means from a naturally occurring population elsewhere or evolved here as part of a chronospecies population that was present in the geographical region before Contra Costa County became a designated entity.</p>
      <p>Examples of a Native Species include the California Red-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana draytonii)</span>, the Blue Oak <span class="taxon">(Quercus douglasii)</span>, and the quite likely now extinct Sooty Crayfish <span class="taxon">(Pacifastacus nigrescens)</span>.</p>
      <p>A quite possibly unacheivable goal of this field guide is to eventually include every Native Species, including those that are now extinct, that were present within the county when John Marsh first settled here.</p>

    <section id="gls.natural_migrant_species" aria-labelledby="migranth3">
      <h3 id="migranth3">Natural Migrant Species</h3>
      <p>A regular naturally occurring visitor species. A <dfn>Natural Migrant Species</dfn> is a species that does not regularly breed in Contra Costa Costa County but for that can be found resising here during part of the year as a regular migration pattern that is part of the <a href="glossary.xhtml" class="gls">natural history</a> for the species.</p>
      <p>Examples of a Natural Migrant Species include the Hooded Merganser <span class="taxon">(Lophodytes cucullatus)</span> and the Golden-crowned Sparrow <span class="taxon">(Zonotrichia atricapilla)</span>.</p>
      <p>A quite possibly unacheivable goal of this field guide is to eventually include every Natural Migrant Species, including those that are now extinct, that were present within the county when John Marsh first settled here. It may be realistic to achieve this goal with birds within a few years, but I do not know if it is realistic to achieve this goal with insects.</p>
