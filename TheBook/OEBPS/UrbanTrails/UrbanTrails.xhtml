    <p>Urban trails, take me out<br/>To the place— I care about<br/>Breeze a blowin’, birds a singin’<br/>Take me out, urban trails</p>
    <p class="author">—Michael A. Peters<br/>Inspired by John Denver ‘Take Me Home, Country Roads’</p>

  <p>Urban trails are trails with an entrance very close to a population center where people live.</p>
  <p>On the one hand, they often lack the biological diversity of the areas farther from population centers, but on the other hand they tend to me far more accessible to those with mobility issues, transportation issues, financial issues, and other related barriers to access that prevent some of us from being able to enjoy the more remote trails as often as we would like.</p>
  <p>This portion of the book will be for urban trails visited frequently by a ‘Trail Curator’ who is responsible for describing the trail, access to the trail, and keeps records in the iNaturalist database for species they encounter on the trail.</p>
  <p>Hopefully this can encourage people to visit these trails more often and enjoy the beuty of nature available right in their own neighborhoods, even if they do not support the same kind of natural diversity you would find at a place like Mount Diablo State Park or Tilden Regional Park.</p>
