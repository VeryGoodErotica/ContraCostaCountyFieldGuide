  <h1 id="marshcreekh1"><abbr>EBRPD</abbr> Marsh Creek Trail, Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr>. to Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr></h1>
  <p>Marsh Creek Trail is a project of the East Bay Regional Park District (<abbr>EBRPD</abbr>). Website: <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/trails/marsh_creek/default.htm" title="Internet Resource">Marsh Creek Regional Trail</a>.</p>
  <p>The segment of the trail this chapter covers extends from Sunset Road to Delta Road, I rarely hike other portions of the trail.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise posted at the trail, this segment of the trail is open seven days a week between the hours of 5:00 <abbr>A.M.</abbr> and 10:00 <abbr>P.M.</abbr></p>
  <p>In addition to the trail itself, I consider Homecoming Park as well as a second trail I call ‘Silver Lupine Trail’ that runs from the Sunset Athletic Complex to about the midway point of this Marsh Creek Trail segment to be part of this Urban Trail study area.</p>
  <p>Why do I call that trail ‘Silver Lupine Trail’?</p>

    <p>Homecoming Park is a small park in Brentwood that primarily serves the small community off of Homecoming Way in Brentwood.</p>
    <p>There is not a parking lot, but there is limited street parking. The park does have picnic tables and a drinking fountain.</p>
    <p>The park borders Marsh Creek. Take the foot bridge over the creek to get to the trail.</p>
    <p>This is the recommended entrance for those coming on foot either from that local community or walking south on Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr> (take a left onto Homecoming Way, which is after the large empty lot just past Hanson Ln)</p>
    <p>Due to a lack of a parking lot, this is probably not a good entrance if coming by car with a wheelchair.</p>

      <p>For current bus routes, schedules, fares, and other transit information, contact <a href="http://trideltatransit.com/" title="Internet Resource">Tri Delta Transit</a>.</p>
      <p>As of <time datetime="2020-03-06">March 2020</time>, the 384, 391, and 393 all stop relative close to Homecoming Park.</p>
      <p>If headed by bus Northbound on Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr>, use the stop just before you reach Lone Tree (Bus Stop 810976). The stop is in front of the Circle A market and gas station.</p>
      <p>Walk to Lone Tree, cross Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr>, head south on Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr> and follow the instructions from Bus Stop 810710.</p>
      <p>If headed by bus Southbound on Brentwood <abbr>Blvs</abbr>, use the stop just after Lone Tree (Bus Stop 810710). Walk south on Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr>, you will pass a hardware store and a couple gas stations, and then a currently empty large lot that does not have a sidewalk. Once past that lot, turn left on Homecoming Way and the park will be just a short distance on your right.</p>

    <p>This entrance has a small often shaded parking lot that can accomodate ten vehicles and rarely has any cars at all parked in it. From the parking lot is a short paved trail that leads to the actual Marsh Creek Trail.</p>
    <p>This is the recommonded entrance if coming by vehicle with a wheelchair. Tresch Road comes off of Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr>. If you are coming from the direction of Brentwood <abbr>Blvd</abbr>, it will be the first left <em>after</em> Trailside Dr. If you are coming from the direction of the Sunset Park Athletic Complex, it will be the first right <em>after</em> Black Diamond Kids Center.</p>
    <p>Please note that this entrance does not have picnic tables or a drinking fountain.</p>

    <p>This entrance technically is the beginning of this trail segment, assuming you are beginning at the southern end of the trail and hiking the direction of the water flow. However there are no parking facilities or picnic tables, so it is not a good place to meet other hikers.</p>
    <p>If you are entering this segment of the trail on foot either by the Mokelumne Coast to Crest Trail (which runs parallel to Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr> on the south side) or by the segment of the Marsh Creek Trail south of Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr>, then this is the best entrance to use.</p>

    <h2 id="athleticcomplexh2">Sunset Park Athletic Complex Entrance</h2>
    <p>Google Maps Link: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=37.95474980,-121.68250000" title="Internet Resource">Sunset Park Athletic Complex Parking Lot</a></p>
    <p>This is a much larger parking lot than is available at the Tresch <abbr>Ave.</abbr> Entrance and is probably the best place to meet for group hikes. However the parking lot is a short distance from the Marsh Creek Trail itself. There is a drinking fountain close to the parking lot, as well as picnic tables.</p>
    <p>At the end of the parking lot is a paved trail that runs along the east side of the ball fields at Sunset Park Athletic Complex and continues past the Brentwood Wastewater Operating until it hits Marsh Creek Trail at about the center of the segment that runs between Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr> and Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr>.</p>
    <p>I call it ‘Silver Lupine Trail’ because there is a decent size plot of land on the east side of the trail where a lot of Silver Lupine <span class="taxon">(Lupinus albifrons)</span> grows. Sometimes Black-tailed Jackrabbits <span class="taxon">(Lepus californicus)</span> can be seen in the Lupine, and from the presence of bones I have found there, I suspect Coyotes <span class="taxon">(Canis latrans)</span> sometimes hunt there too.</p>
    <p>The ‘Silver Lupine Trail’ is not as flat as the Marsh Creek Trail as the Marsh Creek Trail segment itself, but it should not give too much trouble to wheelchairs, the grade is not too steep (I still need to calculate the distance and grade).</p>
    <p>If using this entrance, I recommend taking a right towards Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr> when you hit the Marsh Creek Trail. There are no houses bordering either side of the creek in that direction (unless you cross Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr>) which increases both the bird numbers and variety than is present closer to Sunset <abbr>Rd</abbr>.</p>

  <section id="deltard" aria-labelledby="deltardh2">
    <h2 id="deltardh2">Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr> Entrance</h2>
    <p>Entering the trail segment at this entrance really only makes sense if you are continuing along the Marsh Creek trail from the segment that starts at Creekside Park.</p>
    <p>There is a patch of dirt some fisherman use for parking, but I would highly recommend against doing so unless you have the permission of the land owner for the agricultural land the patch of dirt sometimes used for parking encroaches upon.</p>
    <p>Please note their are neither traffic lights nor a crosswalk between the segment of Marsh Creek Trail north of Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr> and the segment south of Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr>. Usually the traffic is light enough that crossing Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr> is easy, but it is something you should be aware of.</p>
    <p>My <em>personal</em> preference is to use one of the other entrances and then turn around once I reach Delta <abbr>Rd</abbr>.</p>

    <h2 id="accessibilityh2">Trail Accessibility Analysis</h2>
    <p>This portion of the trail is paved and very flat, it is wheelchair friendly.</p>
    <p>Getting to this portion of the trail by bus may be difficult, there is not a paved route from the nearest bus stops that I could find to any of the trail access points. I will be bringing that to the attention of the City of Brentwood.</p>
    <p>There are no benches to sit and rest but this segment of the trail is relatively short but I have not yet calculated distances.</p>
    <p>There are no public restroom that are easily accessible from this portion of the trail.</p>
    <p>There are no drinking fountains on this portion of the trail but two of the entrance points do have drinking fountains.</p>
    <p>There are cyclists who sometimes ride a little too fast for my comfort, but the visibility is really clear, the danger of being creamed by one coming around a blind corner too fast is very low. Most cyclists on this trail are actually quite considerate of pedestrians.</p>
    <p>Cell phone reception is quite good.</p>
