  <h1 id="marshcreekh1"><abbr>EBRPD</abbr> Marsh Creek Trail, Sunset Rd. to Delta Rd</h1>
  <p>Marsh Creek Trail is a project of the East Bay Regional Park District (<abbr>EBRPD</abbr>). Website: <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/trails/marsh_creek/default.htm" title="Internet Resource">Marsh Creek Regional Trail</a></p>
  <p>The segment of the trail this page covers extends from Sunset Road to Delta Road, I rarely hike other portions of the trail.</p>
  <p>In addition to the trail itself, there is a field off a side trail that I consider to be part of this trail.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise posted, this segment of the trail is open between the hours of 5:00 A.M. and 10:00 P.M.</p>
  <p>There are five access points to the trail (Google Maps links coming):</p>
  <ul>
    <!-- note to self - get GPS and make links - http://maps.google.com/?ll=35.028028,-106.536655&z=13 -->

    <li><a href="#treschave">Tresch Ave. Entrance</a> (has parking lot)</li>
    <li><a href="#sunsetrd">Sunset Rd Trail Entrance</a></li>
    <li>Sunset Athletic Complex (Parking lot, long trail to Marsh Creek Trail)</li>
    <li>Delta Road where it passes over the creek (No official parking)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can also enter the trail at Creekside Park off of Laurel Road and walk to this trail segment from there.</p>

    <p>Google Maps Link: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=37.95525030,-121.69416667" title="Internet Resource">Homecoming Park</a></p>
    <p>Homecoming Park is a small park in Brentwood that primarily serves the small community off of Homecoming Way in Brentwood.</p>
    <p>There is not a parking lot, but there is limited street parking. The park does have picnic tables and a drinking fountain.</p>
    <p>The park borders Marsh Creek. Take the foot bridge over the creek to get to the trail.</p>
    <p>This is the recommended entrance for those coming on foot either from that local community or walking south on Brentwood Blvd (take a left onto Homecoming Way, which is after the large empty lot just past Hanson Ln)</p>
    <p>Due to a lack of a parking lot, this is probably not a good entrance if coming by car with a wheelchair.</p>

    <p>Google Maps Link: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=37.95477880,-121.69027778" title="Internet Resource">Tresch Ave. Parking Lot</a></p>
    <p>This entrance has a small often shaded parking lot that can accomodate ten vehicles and rarely has any cars at all parked in it. From the parking lot is a short paved trail that leads to the actual Marsh Creek Trail.</p>
    <p>This is the recommonded entrance if coming by vehicle with a wheelchair. Tresch Road comes off of Sunset Rd. If you are coming from the direction of Brentwood Blvd, it will be the first left <em>after</em> Trailside Dr. If you are coming from the direction of the Sunset Park Athletic Complex, it will be the first right <em>after</em> Black Diamond Kids Center.</p>
    <p>Please note that this entrance does not have picnic tables or a drinking fountain.</p>

    <h3>Sunset Rd Trail Entrance</h3>
    <p>Google Maps Link: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=37.95452970,-121.69361111" title="Internet Resource">Sunset Rd. Trail Entrance</a></p>
    <p>This entrance technically is the beginning of this trail segment, assuming you are beginning at the southern end of the trail and hiking the direction of the water flow. However there are no parking facilities or picnic tables, so it is not a good place to meet other hikers.</p>
    <p>If you are entering this segment of the trail on foot either by the Mokelumne Coast to Crest Trail (which runs parallel to Sunset Rd on the south side) or by the segment of the Marsh Creek Trail south of Sunset Rd, then this is the best entrance to use.</p>

    <h2 id="accessibilityh2">Trail Accessibility Analysis</h2>
    <p>This portion of the trail is paved and very flat, it is wheelchair friendly.</p>
    <p>Getting to this portion of the trail by bus may be difficult, there is not a paved route from the nearest bus stops that I could find to any of the trail access points. I will be bringing that to the attention of the City of Brentwood.</p>
    <p>There are no benches to sit and rest but this segment of the trail is relatively short but I have not yet calculated distances.</p>
    <p>There are no public restroom that are easily accessible from this portion of the trail.</p>
    <p>There are no drinking fountains on this portion of the trail.</p>
    <p>There are cyclists who sometimes ride a little too fast for my comfort, but the visibility is really clear, the danger of being creamed by one coming around a blind corner too fast is very low. Most cyclists on this trail are actually quite considerate of pedestrians.</p>
    <p>Cell phone reception is quite good.</p>
