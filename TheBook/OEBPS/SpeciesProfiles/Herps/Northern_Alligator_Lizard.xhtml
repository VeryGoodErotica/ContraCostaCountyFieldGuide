    <h2 id="rangeh2">Range</h2>
    <p>In Contra Costa County, this species is primarily found in the riparian hills of the west county (El Cerrito, Kensington, Orinda, Lafayette, Tildren Regional Park, Briones Regional Park).</p>
    <p>The species appears to be absent from the northern part of those hills, El Sobrante and north of Briones. It is absent from <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Diablo and its foothills, and the lower elevations with the exception of riparian habitat close to the San Pablo Bay (in the 1980s I found a specimen at Point Pinole Regional Shoreline). My <em>guess</em> is it use to be common in San Pablo, Richmond, and El Cerrito low elevation before the cities were built.</p>
    <p>A recent record that is clearly this species exists for Brooks Island Regional Preserve (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/18530221" title="Internet Resource"><abbr>iNat</abbr> 18530221</a>)</p>

    <p>The <a href="Southern_Alligator_Lizard.xhtml">Southern Alligator Lizard</a> <span class="taxon">(Elgaria multicarinata)</span> has a light yellowish colored iris and the lines on the belly run lengthwise on the <em>center</em> of the scales.</p>
    <section id="skinks" aria-labelledby="skinksh3">
      <h3 id="skinksh3">Skinks <span class="taxon">(genus Plestiodon)</span></h3>
      <p>For the inexperienced, skinks and young alligator lizards are easily confused. It happened to me when I was young and new to field herping.</p>
      <p>Neonatal alligator lizards are the most likely to be confused with skinks. They have a golden brown patternless back other than a series of dots running lengthwise down the spine. Young skinks will have a dark black back bordered with light stripes that start at the nose, and young skinks will have very bright blue or red tail, unless they have lost theit tail which happens.</p>
      <p>Adult Western Skinks <span class="taxon">(P. skiltonianus)</span> have lengthwise striping the length of the body, lack horizontal bars across the back, and lack a fold lengthwise between the sides and the belly. Young Western Skinks have a very bright blue tail.</p>
      <p>Adult Variegated Skinks <span class="taxon">(P. gilberti cancellosus)</span> <em>sometimes</em> have lengthwise striping the length of the body though it can fade with age. They do however lack the horizontal bars across the back.</p>
