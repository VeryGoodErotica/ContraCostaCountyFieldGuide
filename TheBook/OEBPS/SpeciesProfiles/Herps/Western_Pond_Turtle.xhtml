    <h2>Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>Most modern field guides place the Western Pond Turtle in the genus <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and some older field guides place it in the genus <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span>.</p>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Emys</span> was first used in the description of the European Pond Turtle in 1805. This was the genus first used by Baird and Girard when they described this species in 1852.</p>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span> was first used in the description of the Spotted Turtle in 1792.</p>
    <p>The Western Pond Turtle was moved into that genus, along with a few other species. However, genetic studies demonsteated that the Western Pond Turtle, the European Pond Turtle, and the Blanding’s Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys blandingii)</span> formed a very closely related group apart from the others.</p>
    <p>Within these three species complexes, it is not possible to put two into the same genus to the exclusion of the other without there being some paraphyletic issues.</p>
    <p>I need to find the paper (I think Parham and Feldman in 2002 or Spinks and Shaffer 2005), but if I recall correctly what is believed to have taken place, the European Pond Turtle species complex split off from the Western Pond Turtle species complex and the Blanding’s Turtle first. While that would suggest that those two could be in the same genus, there was gene flow introgression from the European Pond Turtle complex into the Western Pond Turtle complex after the Western Pond Turtle complex split from the Blanding’s Turtle.</p>
    <p>Some solve the paraphyletic issues by placing the Western Pond Turtle complex into its own genus <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and the Blanding’s Turtle into its own genus <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> leaving the European Turtle complex alone in <span class="taxon">Emys</span>.</p>
    <p>However others, myself included, feeling that solving the paraphyletic issue by having all three of these closely related species complexes in the same genus makes sense than have three very small genera for them.</p>
    <p>We consider both <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> to be junior synonyms of <span class="taxon">Emys</span>.</p>
    <section id="wpt_subspecies" aria-labelledby="subspeciesh3">
      <h3 id="subspeciesh3">Subspecies</h3>
      <p>Formerly, there were two defined subspecies, the Northwestern Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys marmorata marmorata)</span> and the Southwestern Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys marmorata pallida)</span>. However that subspecies has since been elevated to full species status.</p>
      <p>Originally the two subspecies were defined based upon morphological differences. In West Contra Costa County, much of Alameda County, and in San Francisco and San Mateo County, the turtles were thought to be an integrate form between the Northwestern and Southwestern subspecies.</p>
      <p>However genetics did not agree. The morphological differences appear to be a result of natural selection pressures rather than distinct subspecies clades.</p>
      <p>All naturally occurring Western Pond Turtles in Contra Costa County fall into the clade associated with the <span class="taxon">Emys marmorata</span> and even those with some morphological similarities to the southern three clades are <span class="taxon">Emys marmorata</span> rather than intergrades.</p>
