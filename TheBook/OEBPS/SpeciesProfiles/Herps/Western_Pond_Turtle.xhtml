    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>Western Pond Turtles are our only native species of turtle. A highly aquatic turtle, they are not often found more than a few feet from the waters edge.</p>
  </section>

<!-- range -->
  <section id="range" aria-labelledby="rangeh2">
    <h2 id="rangeh2">Range</h2>
    <p>Historically found throughout Contra Costa County where suitable permanent aquatic habitat with associated upland habitat exists.</p>
    <p>In urban areas their populations may be reduced or absent. Development often encroaches upon the upland habitat they need to successfully reproduce which reduces their population size as young individuals are not there to replace older turtles that die.</p>
    <p>In many urban areas with suitable habitat, the introduced <a href="Red-eared_Slider.xhtml">Red-eared Slider</a> (<abbr>RES</abbr>) significantly outnumbers the Western Pond Turtles, with released pets allowing the <abbr>RES</abbr> population to recruit new members even where the habitat is no longer suitable for reproduction.</p>
    <p>Aquatic habitat infested with the invasive <a href="American_Bullfrog.xhtml">American Bullfrog</a> also interferes Western Pond Turtle reproduction, young turtles are often consumed by the adult Bullfrogs.</p>

    <h2 id="taxoh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>First described by Baird and Girard in 1852.</p>
    <p>Most modern field guides place the Western Pond Turtle in the genus <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and some older field guides place it in the genus <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span>.</p>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Emys</span> was first used when the European Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys orbicularis)</span> was moved out of the genus <span class="taxon">Testudo</span> in 1805. This was the genus first used by Baird and Girard when they described this species in 1852.</p>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span> was first used in the description of the Spotted Turtle <span class="taxon">Clemmys guttata</span> in 1792.</p>
    <p>The Western Pond Turtle was moved into that genus, along with a few other species. However, genetic studies demonstrated that the Western Pond Turtle, the European Pond Turtle (which had not been moved into that genus), and the Blanding’s Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys blandingii)</span> formed a very closely related <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.monophyletic" class="gls">monophyletic</a> group to the exclusion of the other turtles in <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span>. This made <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span> a <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.paraphyletic" class="gls">paraphyletic</a> group, some species had to moved out of it.</p>
    <p>Within these three species complexes, it is not possible to put two into the same genus to the exclusion of the other without there being some paraphyletic issues. Interestingly but off topic, at this point in time, the Spotted Turtle is the only turtle left in <span class="taxon">Clemmys</span>.</p>
    <p>I need to find the paper (I think Parham and Feldman in 2002 or Spinks and Shaffer 2005), but if I recall correctly what is believed to have taken place, the European Pond Turtle species complex split off from the Western Pond Turtle species complex and the Blanding’s Turtle first. While that would suggest that those two could be in the same genus, there was gene flow introgression from the European Pond Turtle complex into the Western Pond Turtle complex after the Western Pond Turtle complex split from the Blanding’s Turtle.</p>
    <p>Some solve the paraphyletic issues by placing the Western Pond Turtle complex into its own genus <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and the Blanding’s Turtle into its own genus <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> leaving the European Turtle complex alone in <span class="taxon">Emys</span>.</p>
    <p>However others, myself included, feeling that solving the paraphyletic issue by having all three of these closely related species complexes in the same genus makes sense than have three very small genera for them.</p>
    <p>We consider both <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> to be junior synonyms of <span class="taxon">Emys</span>.</p>
    <p>It is my <em>suspicion</em> that there recently extinct (since last ice age) species that would not be able to be placed within <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> or <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> without making them paraphyletic, should we discover their fossils, and that placing them into <span class="taxon">Emys</span> would cause <span class="taxon">Emys</span> to be paraphyletic if <span class="taxon">Actinemys</span> and <span class="taxon">Emydoidea</span> are considered to be valid. Using <span class="taxon">Emys</span> for all of them avoids that issue.</p>
    <section id="wpt_subspecies" aria-labelledby="subspeciesh3">
      <h3 id="subspeciesh3">Subspecies</h3>
      <p>Formerly, there were two defined subspecies, the Northwestern Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys marmorata marmorata)</span> and the Southwestern Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys marmorata pallida)</span>. However that subspecies has since been elevated to full species status.</p>
      <p>Originally the two subspecies were defined based upon morphological differences. In West Contra Costa County, much of Alameda County, and in San Francisco and San Mateo County, the turtles were thought to be an integrate form between the Northwestern and Southwestern subspecies.</p>
      <p>However genetics did not agree. The morphological differences appear to be a result of natural selection pressures rather than distinct subspecies clades.</p>
      <p>All naturally occurring Western Pond Turtles in Contra Costa County fall into the clade associated with the <span class="taxon">Emys marmorata</span> and even those with some morphological similarities to the southern three clades are <span class="taxon">Emys marmorata</span> rather than intergrades.</p>
