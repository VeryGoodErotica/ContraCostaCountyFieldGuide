    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>The California Red-legged Frog is our largest <em>native</em> frog, and while people say beauty is in the eye of the bee holder and I do not hold bees very often, I also believe it is our most beautiful frog. In the entire country, it is the most beautiful, with perhaps only the Oregon Spotted Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana pretiosa)</span> as a legitimate co-contender for that designation.</p>
    <p>Before the decline caused by overhavest in the gold rush era followed by the introduction of the <a href="American_Bullfrog.xhtml">American Bullfrog</a> <span class="taxon">(Lithobates catesbeianus)</span>, the California Red-legged Frog was wide-spread through much of California and northern Baja California.</p>
    <p>This species is one of two species of ‘True Frog’ that would have been found in the vicinity of Angel’s Camp in Calavaras County and is the only of of those two species that fits the story that jump-started (pun intended) Mark Twain’s career with <a href="../../CreativeWriting/CelebratedJumpingFrog.xhtml">The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calavaras County</a>.</p>

<!-- species description -->
  <section id="description" aria-labelledby="descriptionh2">
    <h2 id="descriptionh2">Species Description</h2>
    <p>Despite being our largest <em>native</em> frog, the California Red-legged Frog is a medium-sized frog that rareley exceeds 13<abbr>cm</abbr> <abbr>SNV</abbr> (Snout to Vent) (just over 5<abbr>in</abbr>) with females reaching larger sizes than males. Females do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 8.5<abbr>cm</abbr> <abbr>SNV</abbr> at three years of age, while males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size at about two years of age<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON2">ON2</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>The base color of their back is typically a light brown to vibrant red with all shades between. Occassionally the base color is a shade of green. This species has very prominant dorsolateral folds along the sides of the body usually, with several distinct dark (sometimes black) spots on the back between the dorsolateral folds.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The spots are absent in some individuals. Some field guides describe the species as having light centers in the spotting but I have found that to be a farely inconsistent characteristic. From four different sites within Contra Costa County and one site in Marin county, my <em>personal</em> experience is the spotting is far more noticeable on young frogs than on adults although they are often still very prominant on many adults. While searching for remnant populations of <span class="taxon">Rana boylii</span> in streams on Mount Diablo and surrounding areas, small frogs jumping into streams so far has always led to mixed emotions of dissapointment as I notice the spots and enthusiasm at having at least found my favorite frog, even if not the species I was hoping to find.</p>
    <p>Their back and side skin is very granular with bumps, the bumps often seem to line up with the light centers in the spotting when light centers are present.</p>
    <p>On individuals with a more brown or green base color, the dorsolateral fold often has a red or yellow tinge to it, making it extremely noticeable, but that is not always the case.</p>
    <p>Very often on the side of the head, there is a white stripe running along the upper jaw line (sometimes referred to as a ‘jaw stripe’) starting somewhere between the eye and the nostril and ending just above the shoulder. Again, this morphological feature is not always present.</p>
    <p>Compared to many other frogs, their legs are rather long in comparison to the rest of their body, making them exceptional jumpers.</p>
    <p>The underside is smooth and cream-colored with dark mottling, especially under the chin. With mature adults, the underside of their legs and the edges of their belly will often have a distinct red coloration, hence the name of the species, but this feature is not usually present in juvenile frogs.</p>

    <section id="diagnostic" aria-labelledby="diagnostich3">
      <h3 id="diagnostich3">Field Diagnostic</h3>
      <p>Within Contra Costa County, the most reliable field diagnostic for this species is the very prominant dorsolateral fold.</p>
      <p>When only the nose is peeking out of the water, this diagnostic is not always visible and experience may be required to identify the species.</p>

<!-- habitat -->
  <section id="habitat" aria-labelledby="habitath2">
    <h2 id="habitath2">Habitat</h2>
    <p>Generally a frog of lowlands and foothills, within Contra Costa County this species is often found in Oak Woodland and Oak Savanna habitat, not too infrequently in land that is currently used for cattle grazing where stock ponds provide suitable reproductive habitat.</p>
    <p>Usually observed near calm or slow-moving waters where dense vegetation, typically Cattail <span class="taxon">(Typha <abbr>spp.</abbr>)</span>, is available for cover.</p>
    <p>That however is only <em>part</em> of the story. That is where breeding is most common and where they are most likely to be spotted by the casual observer but the California Red-legged Frog frequently makes significant uses of habitat outside their breeding habitat.</p>
  </section>

<!-- reproduction -->
  <section id="reproduction" aria-labelledby="reproductionh2">
    <h2 id="reproductionh2">Reproduction</h2>
    <p>Reproduction takes place from late winter through early spring. The microhabit being used for reproduction plays a factor, with observation in Contra Costa County showing that egg masses were laid a month earlier in <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.lentic_habitat" class="gls">lentic habitat</a> than in <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.lotic_habitat" class="gls">lotic habitat</a><sup class="wc"><a href="#refON1">ON1</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>Fertilization is external with egg masses are deposited in shallow water, <em>usually</em> attached to vegetation. When Cattail <span class="taxon">(Typha <abbr>spp.</abbr>)</span> is available (typically lentic habitat) that seems to be the preferred choice, though other types of vegetation are also utilized, especially in lotic habitats where Cattail is often not present<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON1">ON1</a></sup>.</p>
    <p><em><strong>needed:</strong> A clear high resolution image of an egg mass.</em></p>

<!-- range -->
  <section id="range" aria-labelledby="rangeh2">
    <h2 id="rangeh2">Range and Elevation</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately this species was already experiencing decline before scientific records were well-kept.</p>
    <p>My <em>suspicion</em> is that this species historically was spread throughout Contra Costa County <em>possibly</em> excluding the extreme eastern part of the county where we border San Joaquin County, although it would not surprise me if they were there too.</p>
    <p>Within California itself, based on the range map provided by <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/frogs/maps/rauroramap2.jpg" title="Internet Resource">Gary Nafis of CaliforniaHerps.com</a>, their historic range is along most of the California Coast from lower Mendocino County all the way into Baja California, and in a partial ring around the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Valley extending from the interior foothills of eastern Lake County north to Shasta County on the west side of the valley, east to the foothills of the Cascade Range in Shasta County, and then down the Sierra Nevada foothills through Fresno County to Tulare County.</p>
    <p>The species has vanished from an estimated 70% of its former range [citation needed] with the biggest declines taking place in Southern California. This species now has some legal protections under both federal and state laws.</p>
    <p>In the central and northern part of coastal Mendocino County up into Oregon, the Northern Red-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana aurora)</span> is present with only a very thin contact zone in Mendocino County where both species are present.</p>
    <section id="elevation" aria-labelledby="elevationh3">
      <h3 id="elevationh3">Elevation</h3>
      <p>Within Contra Costa County, elevation is not a limiting factor.</p>
      <p>California Red-legged Frogs can be found at sea level in coastal populations, such as Contra Costa County. The lowest elevation I have <em>personally</em> encountered this species at within Contra Costa County is 120 meters (392 <abbr>feet</abbr>) but I have encountered this species at sea level, literally within 50 meters of the ocean, in Marin County. From personal conversations with Stebbins in my youth, this species was formerly present near sea level in Pinole Creek.</p>
      <p>Their <em>typical</em> elevation within the foothills around the Sacramento / San Joaquin River Valley appears to be from about 200 meters (~650 feet) to 1020 meters (~3350 feet)<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON4">ON4</a></sup>. Records above 1500 meters (~4,900 feet) exist within Yosemite but <em>may</em> actually represent introduced populations rather than natural populations, see <a href="#refON4">ON4</a></sup> page 461.</p>
      <p>California Red-legged Frogs have been re-introduced within Yosemite National Park. I have mixed feelings, part of me feels like this was a publicity stunt and the population will not persist, and that the money would have been better spent helping populations at elevations that are not clearly an extreme statistical outlier to the scientific data on their natural elevation range.</p>

<!-- taxonomy -->
  <section id="taxonomy" aria-labelledby="taxonomyh2">
    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>The California Red-legged Frog was originally described by Baird &amp; Girard as the subspecies <span class="taxon">Rana aurora draytonii</span> in <time>1852</time>.</p>
    <p>Since then, the California Red-legged frog has been elevated to full species status. Interestingly, it appears that the Northern Red-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana aurora)</span> that the California Red-legged Frog formerly was described as a subspecies of, actually forms a clade with the Cascades Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana cascadae)</span> and the Mountain Yellow-legged Frog complex <span class="taxon">(Rana muscosa)</span> to the exclusion of the California Red-legged Frog<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON3">ON3</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>The taxonomy within the <span class="taxon">Ranidae</span> family is currently within a state of flux as we figure out evolutionary relationships.</p>
    <p>Formerly, all members of the family within the United States fell into the genus <span class="taxon">Rana</span>. Within North America, the species group sometimes referred to as the <span class="taxon">Rana boylii</span> group (also referred to as the subgenus <span class="taxon">Amerana</span>) have a more recent common ancestor with European and Asian frogs of the genus <span class="taxon">Rana</span> than they do with other North American frogs in the <span class="taxon">Ranidae</span> family. They are probably a newer arrival to the New World, perhaps having crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Asia at about the same the ancestor of the European Cave Salamanders (genus <span class="taxon">Speleomantes</span>) and the European Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys orbicularis)</span> were crossing over to Asia from North America.</p>
    <p>Currently there are eight defined species within <span class="taxon">Amerana</span> however it is quite possible that the Cascades Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana cascadae)</span> and the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana boylii)</span> are <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.cryptic_species_complex" class="gls">cryptic species complexes</a> each containing more than one species.</p>

    <h2>Similar Species</h2>
    <p>The <a href="American_Bullfrog.xhtml">American Bullfrog <span class="taxon">(Lithobates catesbeianus)</span> lacks a dorsolataral fold. Young American Bullfrogs usually make a very distinctive distress call when they dive into the watet from the shore.</p>
    <p>The <a href="Foothill_Yellow-legged_Frog">Foothill Yellow-legged Frog</a> <span class="taxon">(Rana boylii)</span> has a very weak dorsolataral fold, if present at all, and is usually only found in fast moving rocky streams. When near such streams, California Red-legged Frogs do utilize them. When a you see a frog dive to the bottom where the presence of dorsolateral folds may be hard to make out through the water, look for the distinctive spotting that Red-legged frogs <em>usually</em> have.</p>
