    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>The California Red-legged Frog is our largest <em>native</em> frog, and while people say beauty is in the eye of the bee holder and I do not hold bees very often, I also believe it is our most beautiful frog. In the entire country, it is the most beautiful, with perhaps only the Oregon Spotted Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana pretiosa)</span> as a legitimate co-contender for that designation.</p>
    <p>Before the decline caused by overhavest in the gold rush era followed by the introduction of the <a href="American_Bullfrog.xhtml">American Bullfrog</a> <span class="taxon">(Lithobates catesbeianus)</span>, the California Red-legged Frog was wide-spread through much of California and northern Baja California.</p>
    <p>This species is one of two species of ‘True Frog’ that would have been found in the vicinity of Angel’s Camp in Calavaras County and is the only of of those two species that fits the story that jump-started (pun intended) Mark Twain’s career with <a href="../../CreativeWriting/CelebratedJumpingFrog.xhtml">The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calavaras County</a>.</p>

  <section id="description" aria-labelledby="descriptionh2">
    <h2 id="descriptionh2">Species Description</h2>
    <p>Despite being our largest <em>native</em> frog, the California Red-legged Frog is a medium-sized frog that rareley exceeds 13<abbr>cm</abbr> <abbr>SNV</abbr> (Snout to Vent) (just over 5<abbr>in</abbr>) with females reaching larger sizes than males. Females do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 8.5<abbr>cm</abbr> <abbr>SNV</abbr> at three years of age, while males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size at about two years of age<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON2">ON2</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>The base color of their back is typically a light brown to vibrant red with all shades between. Occassionally the base color is a shade of green. This species has very prominant dorsolateral folds along the sides of the body usually, with several distinct dark (sometimes black) spots on the back between the dorsolateral folds.</p>

    <p>The spots are absent in some individuals. Some field guides describe the species as having light centers in the spotting but I have found that to be a farely inconsistent characteristic. From four different sites within Contra Costa County and one site in Marin county, my <em>personal</em> experience is the spotting is far more noticeable on young frogs than on adults although they are often still very prominant on many adults. While searching for remnant populations of <span class="taxon">Rana boylii</span> in streams on Mount Diablo and surrounding areas, small frogs jumping into streams so far has always led to mixed emotions of dissapointment as I notice the spots and enthusiasm at having at least found my favorite frog, even if not the species I was hoping to find.</p>
    <p>Their back and side skin is very granular with bumps, the bumps often seem to line up with the light centers in the spotting when light centers are present.</p>
    <p>On individuals with a more brown or green base color, the dorsolateral fold often has a red or yellow tinge to it, making it extremely noticeable, but that is not always the case.</p>
    <p>Very often on the side of the head, there is a white stripe running along the upper jaw line (sometimes referred to as a ‘jaw stripe’) starting somewhere between the eye and the nostril and ending just above the shoulder. Again, this morphological feature is not always present.</p>

<!-- reproduction -->
  <section id="reproduction" aria-labelledby="reproductionh2">
    <h2 id="reproductionh2">Reproduction</h2>
    <p>Reproduction takes place from late winter through early spring. The microhabit being used for reproduction plays a factor, with observation in Contra Costa County showing that egg masses were laid a month earlier in <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.lentic_habitat" class="gls">lentic habitat</a> than in <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.lotic_habitat" class="gls">lotic habitat</a><sup class="wc"><a href="#refON1">ON1</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>Egg masses are laid in shallow water and is <em>usually</em> attached to vegetation. When Cattail <span class="taxon">(Typha <abbr>spp.</abbr>)</span> is available (typically lentic habitat) that seems to be the preferred choice, though other types of vegetation are also often utilized, especially in lotic habitats where Cattail is scarce.</p>
    
    <p>An egg mass typically contains N–M eggs[] and are laid in shallow water, <em>generally</em> attacked to Cattail <span class="taxon">(Typha <abbr>spp.</abbr>)</span> in lentic habitats thought other plants are also also used and a wide variety of plants are used in lotic habitats where Cattail is often not available<a href="#refON1">ON1</a>.</p>
    
    
    <p>Reproduction generally takes place from mid-February to mid-March although it has been recorded as early as December and as late as Aprik [citation]</p>
    <p>Males require a minimum of two years to reach sexual maturity while females require a minimum of three years.</p>

    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>The California Red-legged Frog was originally described by Baird &amp; Girard as the subspecies <span class="taxon">Rana aurora draytonii</span> in <time>1852</time>.</p>
    <p>Since then, the California Red-legged frog has been elevated to full species status. Interestingly, it appears that the Northern Red-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana aurora)</span> that the California Red-legged Frog formerly was described as a subspecies of, actually forms a clade with the Cascades Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana cascadae)</span> and the Mountain Yellow-legged Frog complex <span class="taxon">(Rana muscosa)</span> to the exclusion of the California Red-legged Frog<sup class="wc"><a href="#refON3">ON3</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>The taxonomy within the <span class="taxon">Ranidae</span> family is currently within a state of flux as we figure out evolutionary relationships.</p>
    <p>Formerly, all members of the family within the United States fell into the genus <span class="taxon">Rana</span>. Within North America, the species group sometimes referred to as the <span class="taxon">Rana boylii</span> group (also referred to as the subgenus <span class="taxon">Amerana</span>) have a more recent common ancestor with European and Asian frogs of the genus <span class="taxon">Rana</span> than they do with other North American frogs in the <span class="taxon">Ranidae</span> family. They are probably a newer arrival to the New World, perhaps having crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Asia at about the same the ancestor of the European Cave Salamanders (genus <span class="taxon">Speleomantes</span>) and the European Pond Turtle <span class="taxon">(Emys orbicularis)</span> were crossing over to Asia from North America.</p>
    <p>Currently there are eight defined species within <span class="taxon">Amerana</span> however it is quite possible that the Cascades Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana cascadae)</span> and the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana boylii)</span> are <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.cryptic_species_complex" class="gls">cryptic species complexes</a> each containing more than one species.</p>
