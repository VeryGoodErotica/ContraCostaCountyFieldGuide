    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>Snakes evolved from lizards and have a more recent common ancestor with Monitor Lizards than Monitor Lizards have with some other lizards. As such, snakes are a member of the order <a href="Order_Squamata.xhtml" class="taxon">Squamata</a> but are listed here separately due to their significant diversification resulting in a relatively large number of species within Contra Costa County compared to other members of <span class="taxon">Squamata</span>.</p>
    <p>Within <span class="taxon">Serpentine</span>, the family <span class="taxon">Colubridae</span> is used as classification ‘dumping ground’ for snakes that do not readily fit into other existing families. <span class="taxon">Colubridae</span> is the largest family and <em>probably</em> should be broken up into several families but doing so without creating <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.paraphyletic" class="gls">paraphyletic</a> issues may prove to be difficult.</p>
    <p>Within <span class="taxon">Colubridae</span> where <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.monophyletic" class="gls">monophyletic</a> groupings have been described and Contra Costa County has more than one species within the grouping, I have grouped them together.</p>
    <p>We only have two species of snakes within Contra Costa County that are not members of the <span class="taxon">Colubridae</span> family, the Rubber Boa (family <span class="taxon">Boidae</span>) and the Northern Pacific Rattlesnake (family <span class="taxon">Viperidae</span>). They appear in this guide after the <span class="taxon">Colubridae</span> species.</p>

    <p>Within Contra Costa County, do not handle any snake that you can not positively identify as <em>not</em> being a rattlesnake. A rattlesnake bite can be fatal. If the venom does not kill you, the expensive medical cost very well may.</p>
    <p>The Alameda Whipsnake <span class="taxon">(Coluber lateralis euryxanthus)</span> is a protected species and can not be handled without a proper permit. Do not handle any California Whipsnake in either Contra Costa or Alameda Counties unless you can positively identify it <em>with certainty</em> as a Chapparal Whipsnake <span class="taxon">(Coluber lateralis lateralis)</span> first.</p>
    <p>The Giant Gartersnake <span class="taxon">(Thamnophis gigas)</span> is a protected species and can not be handled without a proper permit. If it is even present in Contra Costa County, it would likely be in the northeast corner of the county, in the vicinity of Bethel Island. Fitch in 1940 (citation needed) described the range as including Antioch. Assuming Fitch was correct, it is doubtful that is still the case due to habitat alteration.</p>
    <p>Gartersnakes can be difficult to properly identify from a photograph if certain <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.phenotype" class="gls">phenotype</a> characteristics are not photographed.</p>
    <p>If you can safely capture the specimen and do not mind potentially being bitten (it really does not hurt) or musked, try to get good quality photographs of the upper and lower labials (the scales on the side of the head above and below the jaw), the upper and lower chin shields (the scales on the chin), and the top of the head.</p>
    <p>A good clear photograph of the belly can also frequently help identify the species.</p>
