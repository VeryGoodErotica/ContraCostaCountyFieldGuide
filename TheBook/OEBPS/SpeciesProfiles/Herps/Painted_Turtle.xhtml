    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>Stub. Very incomplete.</p>
    <p>Painted Turtles are the second most commonly kept pet aquatic turtle species, second only to the <a href="Red-eared_Slider.xhtml">Red-eared Slider</a> <span class="taxon">(Trachemys scripta elegans)</span>.</p>
    <p>They are not released nearly as often as Red-eared Sliders, but they are released often enough that there are several records for them in Contra Costa County within the iNaturalist database.</p>
    <p>Most Painted Turtles in the pet trade are the Western subspecies <span class="taxon">(C. p. bellii)</span> but the Eastern subspecies <span class="taxon">(C. p. picta)</span> also has a record in the iNaturalist database for Contra Costa County.</p>

  <section id="range" aria-labelledby="rangeh2">
    <h2 id="rangeh2">Distribution Range</h2>
    <p>Within Contra Costa County, this species is a <a href="../../appendix/concept_terms.xhtml#gls.released_curiosity" class="gls">Released Curiosity</a> without any evidence of reproduction. It is most likely to be found in urban bodies of water, such as the artificial pond at Los Medanos College.</p>
    <p>This species is not native to California. Reportedly introduced at Kaiser Meadow in Siskiyou County (Stebbing 1985) though that population does not seem to still be present (California Herps). Also reportedly introduced at Twitchell Reservoir in San Luis Obispo County (Stebbins 1985). There may be reproducing introduced populations in coastal Southern California.</p>
    <p>The native range of this species is quite extensive. Eastern Coloroda and all of Kansas, north through all of Nebraska and all of the Dakotas into southern Canada. From that range, extend it east all the way to the Atlantic. West of that range, it extends through most of Montana (with some dips into Wyoming), the northern edge of Idaho, and into north-eastern Washington where it then extends down the Columbia River and Willamette river drainages into north-western Oregon. Also present in much of the south-east, but apparently absent from Florida.</p>
    <p>Disjunct populations exist in Utah, Arizona, south-western Colorado, and in New Mexico along the Rio Grande and Pecos river drainages.</p>

    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>The Painted Turtle was first described by Johann G. T. Schneider in <time>1783</time> as <span class="taxon">Testudo picta</span>.</p>
    <section id="subspecies" aria-labelledby="subspeciesh3">
      <h3 id="subspeciesh3">Subspecies</h3>
      <p><strong>FIXME:</strong> glossary links.</p>
      <p>There are currently four recognized subspecies. These subspecies descriptions are based upon morphological characterists which as a general rule often vary significantly within a subspecies. Also note that the allele frequency of a population has constant natural selection pressures and the phenotype of a population does not always align with genetic clades.</p>
      <p>With released Painted Turtles, you can often make a very good guess about subspecies that will often be correct, but when the specimen is not found within a well-known range, you can not always be sure.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Western Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. bellii)</span></dt>
          <dd>This is the subspecies most commonly sold in pet stores and thus released when owners no longer can care for them. It often has a vibrant red border on the plastron with very detailed pattern within.</dd>
        <dt>Eastern Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. picta)</span></dt>
          <dd>This subspecies is <em>sometimes</em> sold in pet stores. The carapace is rather unique, even among Painted Turtles, in that the edges of the scutes line up to form relatively straight lines. (<strong>FIXME:</strong> Illustration needed.) Plastron is generally plain, sometimes with faint spots along the long axis. As of <time datetime="2020-02-28">February 2020</time>, there is only one entry for this subspecies in the iNaturalist database within Contra Costa County: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/11305716" title="Internet Resource"><abbr>iNat</abbr> 11305716</a>. Other sightings are occassionally reported among field herpers.</dd>
        <dt>Midland Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. marginata)</span></dt>
          <dd>This subspecies is very rare in the pet trade but does turn up there.</dd>
        <dt>Southern Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. dorsalis)</span></dt>
          <dd>This subspecies is very rare in the pet trade but does turn up there. Usually has a ver prominent red stripe down the lengthwise axis of the carapace.</dd>
