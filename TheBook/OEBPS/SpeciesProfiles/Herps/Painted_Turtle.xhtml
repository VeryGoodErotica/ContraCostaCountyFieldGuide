    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>Stub. Very incomplete.</p>
    <p>Painted Turtles are the second most commonly kept pet aquatic turtle species, second only to the <a href="Red-eared_Slider.xhtml">Red-eared Slider</a> <span class="taxon">(Trachemys scripta elegans)</span>.</p>
    <p>They are not released nearly as often as Red-eared Sliders, but they are released often enough that there are several records for them in Contra Costa County within the iNaturalist database.</p>
    <p>Most Painted Turtles in the pet trade are the Western subspecies <span class="taxon">(C. p. bellii)</span> but the Eastern subspecies <span class="taxon">(C. p. picta)</span> is also frequently available.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="range" aria-labelledby="rangeh2">
    <h2 id="rangeh2">Distribution Range</h2>
    <p>Within Contra Costa County, this species is a <a href="../../appendix/concept_terms.xhtml#gls.released_curiosity" class="gls">Released Curiosity</a> without any evidence of reproduction. It is most likely to be found in urban bodies of water, such as the artificial pond at Los Medanos College.</p>
    <p>This species is not native to California.</p>

  <section id="taxonomy" aria-labelledby="taxonomyh2">
    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>The Painted Turtle was first described by Johann G. T. Schneider in <time>1783</time> as <span class="taxon">Testudo picta</span>.</p>
    <p>The Painted Turtle was moved out of <span class="taxon">Testudo</span> into its own monotypic genus <span class="taxon">Chrysemys</span> in <time>1855</time> by John Edward Gray. Unless you consider the Southern Painted Turtle to be a distinct species rather than a subspecies, the Painted Turtle is the only extant species in that genus.</p>
    <p>The Southern Painted Turtle apparently does hybridize with both the Eastern and Midland subspecies where they come in contact and for that reason, many still consider it to be a subspecies. However, hybridization can occur while there still is a significant barrier to gene flow between the populations, so hybridization does not indicate the populations are on the same evolutionary path.</p>
    <section id="subspecies" aria-labelledby="subspeciesh3">
      <h3 id="subspeciesh3">Subspecies</h3>
      <p><strong>FIXME:</strong> glossary links.</p>
      <p>There are currently four recognized subspecies. These subspecies descriptions are based upon morphological characterists which as a general rule often vary significantly within a subspecies. Also note that the allele frequency of a population has constant natural selection pressures and the phenotype of a population does not always align with genetic clades.</p>
      <p>With released Painted Turtles, you can often make a very good guess about subspecies that will often be correct, but when the specimen is not found within a well-known range, you can not always be sure.</p>
      <section id="westernsub" aria-labelledby="westernsubh4">
        <h4 id="westernsubh4">Western Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. bellii)</span></h4>
        <p>This is the subspecies most commonly sold in pet stores and thus released when owners no longer can care for them.</p>
        <p>Western Painted Turtles usually have a vibrant red border on their plastron with a very detailed pattern within that border.</p>
        <p>Even though the plastron is hard to see unless holding the turtle, the vibrant red can often be visually seen when they are basking. This characteristic is unique to this subspecies.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="easternsub" aria-labelledby="easternsubh4">
        <h4 id="easternsubh4">Eastern Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. picta)</span></h4>
        <p>This subspecies is <em>sometimes</em> sold in pet stores, although not nearly as often as the Western Painted Turtle.</p>
        <p>A rather distinctive feature of this subspecies, the vertebrate scutes <em>usually</em> line up with the adjacent costal scutes so that there are near perfect horizontal lines between scutes from the left marginal scutes to the right marginal scutes. This phenoma does not always happen, but it does with the majority of turtles of this subspecies. It does not happen, or very rarely happens, in other most other turtles, including other subspecies of the Painted Turtle.</p>
        <p>The plastron is generally plain, sometimes with faint spots along the long axis.</p>

        <p>As of <time datetime="2020-02-28">February 2020</time>, there is only one entry for this subspecies in the iNaturalist database within Contra Costa County: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/11305716" title="Internet Resource"><abbr>iNat</abbr> 11305716</a>. Other sightings are <em>occassionally</em> reported among field herpers.</p>

        <h4 id="southernsubh4">Southern Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. dorsalis)</span></h4>
        <p>This subspecies is not common in the pet trade but it does sometimes turn up there.</p>
        <p>This subspecies <em>usually</em> has a very prominant red stripe running lengthwise down the carapace. This subspecies may actually be a distinct species in its own right rather than a subspecies of <span class="taxon">Chrysemys picta</span> [<a href="../../appendix/works_cited.xhtml#Starkey_et_al-2003">Starkey et. al. 2003</a>].</p>

      <section id="midlandsub" aria-labelledby="midlandsubh4">
        <h4 id="midlandsubh4">Midland Painted Turtle <span class="taxon">(C. p. marginata)</span></h4>
        <p>This subspecies is not common in the pet trade but it does sometimes turn up there.</p>
        <p>If you are sure a turtle is a Painted Turtle and you have ruled out Western and Eastern and the turtle does not have a prominent red stripe down the carapace, it could be this subspecies.</p>
