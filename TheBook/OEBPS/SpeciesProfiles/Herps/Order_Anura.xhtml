    <p>Frogs and Toads <em>probably</em> initially evolved during the Permian geological time period, roughly 265 million years ago. In 2019, a 120 year old fossil of a frog that had consumed a salamander was found in China. What a find!</p>
    <p>Frogs and Toads are tailess <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.tetrapod" class="gls">tetrapods</a> with porous skin. They are carnivorous and have large mouths relative to the size of their heads, often with a very long toungue they use to catch their prey and draw it inside their mouth. Their eyes bulge out from the head, and their hind limbs generally are much longer than their front limbs, facilitation locomotion by jumping or hopping. The hind feet are often webbed allowing them to more readily swim through water.</p>
    <p>With a very few exceptions, fertilization is external. The male frog will use a vocalization (often called ‘croaking’) to attract a female and then mount her back in a position known as <em>amplexus</em> by grasping her waist with his forearms. For this reason, in many species, males have developed rough toepads (often called nuptual pads) to help them grasp the female.</p>
    <p>The male releases his sperm as the eggs are released from the female, fertilizing them in the process. With a very few exceptions, eggs are laid in a body of water as an egg mass or as a string of eggs.</p>
    <p>The eggs hatch into tadpoles going through an aquatic life phase (colloquially called ‘pollywogs’ in some areas) where many species are largely vegetarian. Tadpoles lack lungs and intake oxygen through gills, which can be either internal or external, depending upon the species.</p>
    <p>The hind legs generally develop first, followed by the front limbs and then they develop the lungs they use to breathe as adults. For the final stage of metamorphis from tadpole to adult form, the tail is absorbed into the body.</p>
    <p>Unlike some salamander species, it is not normal for tadpoles to become <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.neotonic" class="gls">neotonic</a> although there is at least one documented case where it seems to have happened.</p>
    <p>In many (all?) species, the biological sex of a specimen is determined by environment factors during the larval stage. In some species, adults switching sex has been documented.</p>
    <p>Due to their porous skin, many frogs and toads are particularly vulnerable to chemical polutants. Please do not handle them if you have used anti-bacterial soap, hand lotions, sunscreen, or otherwise may have contaninants on your hands.</p>
    <p>Many species of frogs and toads are currently experiencing massive population declines and extinctions, caused by a variety of factors, most of which humans contribute to.</p>
