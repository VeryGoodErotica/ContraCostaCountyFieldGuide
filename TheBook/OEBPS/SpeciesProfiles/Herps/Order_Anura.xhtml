    <h2 id="overviewh2">Order Overview</h2>
    <p>Frogs and Toads <em>probably</em> initially evolved during the Permian geological time period, roughly 265 million years ago. In 2019, a 120 year old fossil of a frog that had consumed a salamander was found in China. What a find!</p>
    <p>Frogs and Toads are tailless <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.tetrapod" class="gls">tetrapods</a> with porous skin. They are carnivorous and have large mouths relative to the size of their heads, often with a very long toungue they use to catch their prey and draw it inside their mouth. Their eyes bulge out from the head, and their hind limbs generally are much longer than their front limbs, facilitation locomotion by jumping or hopping. The hind feet are often webbed allowing them to more readily swim through water.</p>
    <p>With a very few exceptions, fertilization is external. The male frog will use a vocalization (often called ‘croaking’) to attract a female and then mount her back in a position known as <em>amplexus</em> by grasping her waist with his forearms. For this reason, in many species, males have developed rough toepads (often called nuptual pads) to help them grasp the female.</p>
    <p>The male releases his sperm as the eggs are released from the female, fertilizing them in the process. With a very few exceptions, eggs are laid in a body of water as an egg mass or as a string of eggs.</p>
    <p>The eggs hatch into tadpoles going through an aquatic life phase (colloquially called ‘pollywogs’ in some areas) where many species are largely vegetarian. Tadpoles lack lungs and intake oxygen through gills, which can be either internal or external, depending upon the species.</p>
    <p>The hind legs generally develop first, followed by the front limbs and then they develop the lungs they use to breathe as adults. For the final stage of metamorphis from tadpole to adult form, the tail is absorbed into the body.</p>
    <p>Unlike with some salamander species (but none is our areaa), it is not normal for tadpoles to become <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.neotonic" class="gls">neotonic</a> although there is at least one documented case where it seems to have happened.</p>
    <p>In many (all?) species, the biological sex of a specimen is determined by environment factors during the larval stage. In some species, adults switching sex has been documented.</p>
    <p>Due to their porous skin, many frogs and toads are particularly vulnerable to chemical polutants. Please do not handle them if you have used anti-bacterial soap, hand lotions, sunscreen, or otherwise may have contaninants on your hands.</p>
    <p>Many species of frogs and toads are currently experiencing massive population declines and extinctions, caused by a variety of factors, most of which humans contribute to.</p>

    <h2 id="inaturalisth2">iNaturalist Frog Photography</h2>
    <p>For the so-called ‘True Frogs’, try to get a photograph of the back and sides. The presence and strength of the dorsolateral fold can often help identify the species when it is not otherwise visually obvious.</p>
    <p>For really small frogs, the size of a nickel or smaller, try to get a photograph of the side of the head. Small Foothill Yellow-legged Frogs <span class="taxon">(Rana boylii)</span> are often confused with Sierran Treefrogs <span class="taxon">(Pseudacris sierra)</span> but the latter has a very distinctive eye stripe that the former lacks.</p>
    <p>The California Red-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana draytonii)</span> is a protected species and can not be handled without a proper permit. They are still readily found in many parts of the county where suitable habitat exists that has not been infested by American Bullfrogs <span class="taxon">(Lithobates catesbeianus)</span>. Check cattle ponds with lots of cattails. The presense of the Aquatic Gartersnake <span class="taxon">(Thamnophis atratus)</span> is a good sign.</p>
    <p>The Foothill Yellow-legged Frog <span class="taxon">(Rana boylii)</span> is a protected species and can not be handled without a proper permit. If they are still present within Contra Costa County, they would likely only be found on Mount Diablo or in the surrounding foothills.</p>
    <p>The Western Spadefoot Toad <span class="taxon">(Spea hammondii)</span> is a protected species and can not be handled without a proper permit. They are easily distinguishable from other frogs and toads in our area by their cat-like verticle pupils. If they are still present in Contra Costa County, they would be present in the far eastern portion of the county, adjacent to San Joaquin County (where they are still present, see the <a href="http://www.naherp.com/search.php?r_group=3&amp;r_genus=2513&amp;r_species=2515&amp;r_country=1&amp;r_state=24&amp;r_county=1631" title="Internet Resource">H.E.R.P. database</a>.)</p>
