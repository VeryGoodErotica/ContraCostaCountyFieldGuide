    <h2 id="rangeh2">Range</h2>
    <p>In recent times this species was restricted to tropical and subtropical Africa (excluding the Sahara Desert) and the Iberian Peninsula with a separate disjunct population that possibly includes a distinct species in the Indian subcontinent east through tropical southern Asia.</p>
    <p>During the late 19th century, quite likely as a result of modern agriculture providing additional habitat for hunting insects, the African population spread towards southern Africa and made its way across the Atlantic Ocean where the first recorded sighting in Guiana and Suriname were made in 1877 (citation needed).</p>
    <p>How the species crossed the Atlantic is not known, but given that a natural range expansion within Africa was taking place prior to it showing up on the northern Atlantic coast of South America, the assumption of natural dispersion is a logical assumption without evidence of an accidental or intentional introduction involving humans.</p>
    <p>Cattle Egrets were first spotted in the United States during the early 1940s and were recorded to be breeding in Florida in the early 1950s. It is now fairly widespread throughout much of North America including the California Sacramento and San Joaquin River Valleys. There are iNatural citizen science records for this species in both Solano County (e.g. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/27477497" title="Internet Resource">Record 27477497</a>) and San Joaquin County (e.g. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/29666488" title="Internet Resource">Record 29666488</a>).</p>
    <p>As of <time datetime="2020-02-23">February 23, 2020</time> I was not able to find any records in the iNaturalist database within Contra Costa County that are verifiably this species but it is almost certainly present in the interior valley of the north-eastern part of the county. I will be looking for it in agricultural fields.</p>
    <p>The population in our part of California may only be present during their breeding season rather than as a year-round population.</p>

    <p>Both the <a href="Snowy_Egret.xhtml">Snowy Egret</a> <span class="taxon">(Egretta thula)</span> and the Cattle Egret are roughly the same shape and size with primarily white feathers. However the Cattle Egret has a yellowish to orange beak that readily distinguishes it from the Snowy Egret, which has a blueish gray beak (except for breeding Snowy Egret adults which have a dark almost blackish beak). Also, Breeding adult Cattle Egrets have a light tanish (often described as buff) coloration on their chest, side, and back (photo needed).</p>
    <p>Snowy Egrets and Cattle Egrets also have a different <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.natural_history" class="gls">Natural History</a>. Snowy Egrets largely feed upon fish and are thus far more likely to be spotted in or near water. Cattle Egrets frequently feed on insects and are thus far more likely to be found in fields, especially in the vicinity of <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.ungulate" class="gls">ungulates</a> that both attract and root up insects.</p>
    <p>The <a href="Great_Egret.xhtml">Great Egret</a> <span class="taxon">(Ardea alba)</span> is also similar in appearance to the Cattle Egret, though the Great Egret is a substantially larger bird.</p>

  <section id="taxonomy" aria-labelledby="taxonomyh2">
    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>First described by Carl Linnæus in 1758 as <span class="taxon">Ardea ibis</span> but moved into the new genus <span class="taxon">Bubulcus</span> in 1855 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte.</p>
    <p>Some ornithologists view the genus <span class="taxon">Bubulcus</span> as having two species, with the population native to Asia primarily east of the Indian sub-continent as a distinct species, the Eastern Cattle Egret <span class="taxon">(Bubulcus coromandus)</span>. Others see those two populations as <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.conspecific" class="gls">conspecific</a> but representing two subspecies, leaving the genus <span class="taxon">Bubulcus</span> as a <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.monotypic" class="gls">monotypic</a> genus.</p>
    <p>The Cattle Egrets in our area are descended from the Africa Population. If the conspecific view with subspecies is taken, our Cattle Egrets would be the Western Cattle Egret <span class="taxon">(Bubulcus ibis ibis)</span>.</p>
