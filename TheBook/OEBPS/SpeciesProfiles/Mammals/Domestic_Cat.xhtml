    <p>Stub. Content to be written.</p>
    <p>It can be difficult to distinguish between Domestic Cats that live inside a home and Domestic Cats that are feral. Feral cats often are not as well-groomed due to Flea (genus <span class="taxon">Ctenocephalides</span>) infestations, among other parasites, but some feral cats appear healthier than some pets with homes.</p>
    <p>The vast majority of predator animals only hunt when they are hungry, including the wild ancestors of the Domestic Cat. Domestic Cats and Humans are rather unique in that we also hunt just for sport. Humans can (though they do not always) ecologically manage our sport hunting, but Domestic Cats have not evolved that kind of cognitive understanding and as a result, they continue to cause incredible ecological damage to bird, reptile, and insect communities.</p>
    <p>As a ‘cat lover’ myself, I respectfully request that other cat owners <em>please</em> keep your cats indoors.</p>
    <p>As a ‘wildlife lover’ I respectfully request that you do not participate in <abbr>TNR</abbr> (Trap, Neuter, Return) programs. The returned cats continue to cause severe ecological damage and kill far more animals than they need to to survive.</p>
    <p>I also respectfully request that you do not feed feral cats with one exception. Feral kittens that are still young enough to find homes, sometimes I use food just to get them to trust me enough that I can catch them and foster them while looking for someone to adopt it. Those are the only conditions under which food should be offered to a feral cat.</p>
