    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>The presence of this species within Contra Costa County has not yet been scientifically confirmed. If it is present here, it may be a different subspecies than the species in the above photograph from Del Norte County, which also has not yet been scientifically confirmed.</p>
    <p>Reports of this species within Contra Costa County are very rare, but the sightings may be under reported because as a schedule I controlled substance, the harvesting and consumption of psilocybin mushrooms in Mount Diablo State Park is illegal. Those who have seen this species there may be afraid of their stash being confiscated.</p>

  <section id="description" aria-labelledby="descriptionh2">
    <h2 id="descriptionh2">Physical Description</h2>
    <p>A large <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.bipedal" class="gls">bipedal</a> primate, the bipedalism appears to be the result of <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.convergent_evolution" class="gls">convergent evolution</a> rather than an indication of a close ancestral relation with humans.</p>
    <p>Like most primates, Sasquatch is described as having a body mostly covered with hair. Their hair however seems to have a very unique feature, it breaks down quickly when detached from the body.</p>
    <p>While we do not have any specimens to directly investigate, we can come to that conclusion through deductive reasoning and <a href="../../appendix/glossary.xhtml#gls.occams_razor" class="gls">Occam’s razor</a>. All sighting of this species seem to occur where there is rather dense tree cover and bushes, but we do not have usable hair samples for analyzing the genetics of this species, samples taken usually end up belonging to bears.</p>
    <p>With how often they are witness in trees with dense vegetation, it is reasonable to conclude some hair would be left behind. It can be deduced that the hair quickly breaks down, making it useless for genetic analysis. This is a much more logical explanation than the alternative, which is the suggestion that it somehow ‘magically’ transforms to have bear <abbr>DNA</abbr>. <abbr>DNA</abbr> just does not work that way.</p>
    <p>Descriptions in size range from about six feet to eight feet in height with a heavier build than typical humans. It has been suggested that there is sexual dimorphism with males being much larger than females, however I suspect the larger sizes are fear driven imagination and that the species <em>probably</em> is only slightly taller than the average human.</p>
    <p>With many reports, their head appears to be closer to their neck than with humans and their shoulders are proportionally broader than with humans. This could help reduce whiplash effects for populations that nest high in the forest canopy when they drop from heights to the ground to gather food.</p>
    <p>The most described feature is their proportionally larger feet, often a foot and a half in length or even longer from heel to toe. Their feet seem to lack an arch, but it is really difficult to determine since so many foot castings have been demonstrated to be hoaxes.</p>

<!-- habitat -->
  <section id="habitat" aria-labelledby="habitath2">
    <h2 id="habitath2">Habitat</h2>
    <p>Generally this species seems to prefer the conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest, the population here seems to have adapted to the Oak Woodland habitat of Mount Diablo and as such it may be a different subspecies than their relatives to the north.</p>
  </section>

<!-- behavior -->
  <section id="behavior" aria-labelledby="behaviorh2">
    <h2 id="behaviorh2">Behavior and Diet</h2>
    <p>Little is known about the social structure of this species, but is is speculated that the species is rather solitary in nature other than for reproduction. This is unusual among primates but there is evidence that that during the climate change of the Pleistocene era, the usual <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus</span> diet of bamboo became more scarce resulting in more fruits in their diet. Evolving to a more solitary lifestyle with low population density would decrease the inter-species competition for resources.</p>
    <p>Like their ancestors in southeast Asia, Sasquatch appear to be largely if not completely vegetarian. I suspect that Acorns make up a large part of their diet. When the California Turkey <span class="taxon">(Meleagris californica)</span> vanished from the state about 10,000 years ago, Sasquatch that left the pacific northwest conifer habitat for the Oak Woodland may have played a very important role in continuing the acorn dispersal for the Oak Trees.</p>
    <p>Reports of creatures that very likely are this species occur in the southeastern United States accompanied by claims that they are very odoriferous and consume young birds and alligators, but there is no actual evidence this is the case. The fossil teeth we have from their likely ancestors indicate a vegetation diet, and no stool samples exist to confirm they have evolved an omnivorous diet since then.</p>
    <p>While it is <em>possible</em> the southeastern population is an omnivorous subspecies or perhaps a distinct species, I believe it is a case of mistaking correlation with cause and effect. The diet including alligator meat is largely based upon reports of them coming from the vicinity of alligator caves, but I think it is far more likely they use these caves to gather fungi species that grow in dark damp places for food.</p>
    <p>That is not as sensational as eating alligators, but it makes more sense. It also could explain why the southeastern population is often associated with a distinct smell. Fungi grow best with decaying matter which often has as an odor. However some people like to believe really sensational claims of them eating alligators. People can be very gullible with sensational claims.</p>
    <p>A very shy creature, it is not known where Sasquatch spend their days. With a few exceptions they are only observed when the light is too poor for clear photography, they may not venture from their hidden nesting sites very often during the middle of the day.</p>
    <p>Sasquatch also seems to have developed a keen instinct for detecting camera traps and are very good at avoiding them. What photographic evidence that does exists seems to suggest that Sasquatch also have a unique ability to generate an accoustic wave form outside our hearing range that interferes with the ability of camera lenses to get a sharp focus. This phenomena needs more study as it potentially has privacy applications for humans.</p>
    <p>While Sasquatch seem to be a solitary species with low population densities, they are clearly aware of each other and communicate with each other and still have a close social structure.</p>
    <p>This certainly developed within southeast Asia. No <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus</span> fossils have been found that date to the era of Modern Man <span class="taxon">(Homo sapiens)</span> or any fossils outside of southeast Asia. For the genus to have survived until the present without leaving fossil evidence, they must have developed a way of disposing of their dead in such a way that finding fossils would be extremely rare.</p>
    <p>This is a very significant achievement, even hominids do not that have that skill. It also indicates a deep compassion for each other, clearly it is very important to them that their dead are not consumed by scavengers. This level of compassion for their dead is very rare among animals, our species could learn a thing or two from them.</p>

  <section id="conservation" aria-labelledby="conservationh2">
    <h2 id="conservationh2">Conservation</h2>
    <p>With a combination of their relatively low population density and population fragmentation as a result of agriculture in former Oak Woodland, genetic bottleneck of the population within Contra Costa County is a serious concern.</p>
    <p>Much of their remaining habitat is either within Mount Diablo State Park or within land under the East Bay Regional Park District management.</p>
    <p>It is therefore critical that we keep those parks well funded so that the habitat may be maintained.</p>
    <p>Even if a population of Sasquatch in Contra Costa County is never confirmed, the Oak Woodland in those areas is of tremendous benefit to other species within Contra Costa County, including the other primate (Modern Man) that is known to be here.</p>

<!-- taxonomy -->
  <section id="taxonomy" aria-labelledby="taxonomyh2">
    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus</span> was first described by Ralph von Koenigswald in <time>1935</time> based upon fossilized teeth and bones found in an apothecary shop in Asia.</p>
    <p>Several fossils belong to the genus have since been discovered in southeast Asia, resulting in three officially described species:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus blacki</span></li>
      <li><span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus bilaspurensis</span></li>
      <li><span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus giganteus</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Inclusion of Sasquatch within that genus within this field guide is speculatory that Sasquatch either has one of those species as a paleospecies ancestor, or has a most recent common ancestor with those species to the exclusion of other primates.</p>
    <p><span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus blacki</span> appears to have gone exist about 100,000 years ago and coexisted with <span class="taxon">Homo erectus</span>. This makes <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus blacki</span> a likely candidate to be an ancestor of Sasquatch.</p>
    <p>The genus <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus</span> is speculated to have diverged from the Orangutan lineage about ten to twelve million years ago. This divergence is prior to the divergence of humans and chimpanzees.</p>
    <p>Taxonomy has this rule where a type specimen has to exist for scientific examination before a taxonomy name is officially assigned. This rule exists in large part to help determine when two different descriptions are actually of the same species and are thus conspecific.</p>
    <p>In the case of Sasquath, there really is no other described species they can be considered to be conspecific with, which is why I have taken the liberty of giving them a described taxonomic name without a type specimen.</p>
    <p>Similar to the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimps, <span class="taxon">Pan prior</span>, the taxonomical name used here should not be considered official. In the event that a type specimen is obtained, it is likely that <span class="taxon">Gigantopithecus macropodiatus</span> will become an ‘unofficial’ junior synonym to a different taxonomical name.</p>
