  <section id="overview" aria-labelledby="overviewh2">
    <h2 id="overviewh2">Species Overview</h2>
    <p>Stub. Content to be written. Natural History behavior content will likely be based upon close relatives.</p>
    <p>Possibly extinct. The first specimen was collected in <time>1918</time>, brought home by a Domestic House Cat at the top of Dwight Way in Berkeley. The last confirmed specimen I am aware of was collected in <time>1940</time> at the Calaveras Reservoir in Santa Clara County. Only 20 specimens of this subspecies have ever been collected, not much is known about its natural history other than it is presumed to be similar to its closest relative, the Tulare Kangaroo Rat <span class="taxon">(Dipodomys heermanni tularensis)</span>.</p>
    <p>I <em>believe</em> I encountered this species during the 1980s while camping with the Boy Scouts in Briones Regional Park. At the time I did not know the signifigance of what I saw, the only mammal field guide I owned was <span class="booktitle">Mammals of the San Francisco Bay Region</span> by William D. and Elizabeth Berry (University of California Press, <time>1959</time>; <abbr>ISBN</abbr> <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/0520001168" title="Internet Resource">0-520-00116-8</a>) which I used what I saw to identify it as a Heermann Kangaroo Rat. It is of course possible I saw something else, it was night and only briefly illuminated by my flashlight before it vanished into the bushes.</p>
    <p>In a <time datetime="2012-05-07">May 7, 2012</time> <a href="https://bioaccumulation.wordpress.com/tag/berkeley-kangaroo-rat/" data-wayback="https://web.archive.org/web/20200307073419/https://bioaccumulation.wordpress.com/tag/berkeley-kangaroo-rat/" title="Internet Resource">blog article</a> by Mathew Bettelheim, he mentions that eight Kangaroo Rats have been trapped since <time>2000</time> near the Ohlone Regional Wilderness. These specimens have morphological characteristics of both the Berkeley Kangaroo Rat and the Tulare Kangaroo Rat, but at the time of the blog posting, genetic testing had not yet been done to resolve what they are.</p>
    <p>To find a remnant population within Contra Costa County, perhaps in the Mount Diablo foothills, would be an incredible find.</p>

<!-- range -->
  <section id="range" aria-labelledby="rangeh2">
    <h2 id="rangeh2">Range</h2>
    <p>Within Contra Costa County, the historic range of this species was <em>probably</em> restricted the chaparral habitat in the east bay hills, the Mount Diablo foothills, and on Mount Diablo at elevations below 3000 feet (910<abbr>m</abbr>).</p>

<!-- conservation status -->
  <section id="conservation" aria-labelledby="conservationh2">
    <h2 id="conservationh2">Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Currently presumed extinct. However, if a remnant population persists, it is quite likely in habitat already designated for conservation to benefit the Alameda Whipsnake <span class="taxon">(Coluber lateralis euryxanthus)</span>.</p>
    <p>It is not known what caused the decline and presumed extinction of this species. Domestic and Feral cat <span class="taxon">(Felis catus)</span> and habitat destruction for urban development certainly played a role, but I do not believe they were the only factors as the species appears to have declined or vanished even in areas where those factors are not at play.</p>
    <p>I suspect a disease brought by an introduced rodent species that Berkeley Kangaroo Rats are particularly susceptible to may have contributed but that is highly speculatory.</p>

<!-- taxonomy -->
  <section id="taxonomy" aria-labelledby="taxonomyh2">
    <h2 id="taxonomyh2">Taxonomy Notes</h2>
    <p>Initially described in <time>1918</time> by Joseph Grinnell as a distinct species, it was later reclassified as a subspecies of the Heermann’s Kangaroo Rat <span class="taxon">(Dipodomys heermanni)</span>. The subspecies was described when morphological characteristics were often used to justify subspecies designation, I do not know if genetic analysis has confirmed the validity of this subspecies.</p>
    <p>Finding a remnant population well within the known historic defined range may make it easier for such an analysis to be performed.</p>
