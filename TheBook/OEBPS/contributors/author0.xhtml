  <h1 id="authorh1">Michael A. Peters</span></h1>
  <p>Michael Peters, who goes by the user name ‘<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/marshcreekmichael" title="Internet Resource">marshcreekmichael</a>’ on iNaturalist and sometimes the name ‘Alice’ elsewhere (a reference to the ‘Alice and Bob’ crytpgraphy tutorials and a tip of the hat to the rocker Alice Cooper), is the visionary behind this project.</p>
  <p>In addition to acting as the Chief Editor, Michael is Herpetology Taxon Curator and the Urban Trails curator for the segment of Marsh Creek Trail between Sunset Road and Delta Road in Brentwood.</p>
  <p>Michael grew up in Contra Costa County where he greatly benefited from the privilege of knowing Dr. Robert C. Stebbins in his youth, and he loved to go hiking in Tilden Regional Park.</p>
  <p>He has a small collection of mugs from National Parks he has visited an adult including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crater Lake National Park</li>
    <li>Yellowstone National Park</li>
    <li>Joshua Tree National Park</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Michael would really like to add a mug from Great Basin National Park in Nevada, but he has to visit the park to get one. He also wishes to go back to Joshua Tree when it is not summer.</p>
