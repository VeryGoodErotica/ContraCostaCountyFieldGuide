  <aside>
    <p>At one point in time, <a href="https://pixabay.com/" title="Internet Resource">Pixabay</a> used the <a href="CC0_1_0.xhtml">CC0</a> license for all images and videos uploaded to their site.</p>
    <p>Once they had a rather significant number of images, they silently changed the usage license to their own. Bait and Switch cow manure.</p>
    <p>The new license is only compatible with use in the <a href="CC_BY_4_0.xhtml">CC BY-SA</a> field guide if the following conditions are met:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only still image photographic content is used.</li>
      <li>No people are used in the image. This satisfies <a href="#Rc" >restriction c</a>.</li>
      <li>No products, brands, or trademarks are used in the image. This satisfies <a href="#Rd" >restriction d</a>.</li>
      <li>The image is modified in such a manner that it is readily visually different from the image as it appears on Pixabay. Cropping the image meets that requirement. This helps satisfy <a href="#Ra">restriction a</a> and <a href="#Rb">restriction b</a>.</li>
      <li>The largest side of the image is not more than 2048 pixels and the smallest side of the image is not more than 1024 pixels. This helps satisfy <a href="#Ra">restriction a</a> and <a href="#Rb">restriction b</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use of Pixabay content is discouraged but Content Curators for this field guide are allowed to use images from Pixabay when suitable content is not available from a <a href="CC_BY-SA_4_0.xhtml">CC BY-SA</a>, <a href="CC_BY_4_0.xhtml">CC BY</a>, <a href="CC0_1_0.xhtml">CC0</a>, or <a href="https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain" title="Internet Resource">Verifiable Public Domain</a> source as long as the above guidelines are met.</p>
    <p>However Content Curators are <em>encouraged</em> to attempt contact the photographer to both get the real name of the photographer and explicit permission outside the context of Pixabay to use the image under the terms of the <a href="CC_BY-SA_4_0.xhtml">CC BY-SA</a> license.</p>
