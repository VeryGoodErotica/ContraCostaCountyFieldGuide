Original Resources
==================

Many resources in the ePub will be modified and/or lossy compressed. This
directory is for the original files so that the original source can be used
to recreate the resources in the ePub as needed in the future.

The resources will have a unique filename that is the hex md5 digest of the
sha384 digest of the file, in UUID format (though technically not a UUID),
with the appropriate file extension. This allows verification that the file
has not been altered.

Many of these resources will be too large in size to include in the github
repository and the entire point is there are no revisions, so many of the
files in this directory will actually be hosted elsewhere. A script in the
`utilities` directory will fetch them. That has not been set up yet.
